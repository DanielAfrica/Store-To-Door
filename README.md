# Store-To-Door
This repository showcases my Data Analytic skills, specifically in the business sector (Business Analysis).

This is an exciting project I started to put my new taught skills from my time during my studies (primarily Data Analysis). I focus on particular types sales within the store I work at.

Within this repository I have placed 3 documents relating to my Project Store-To-Door:

1. An excel document where I recorded all of my data.
2. A Power BI dashboard displaying filtered information.
3. A PDF document compounding all relevant materials to present my highlighted and summarised conclusion of Store-to-Door sales at Factorie Table Bay Mall.
